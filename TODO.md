# TODO

> [!NOTE]
> Update this list at the end of each sprint and roll completed items into release notes or changelog entries.

## Now (MVP demo path)

- [x] Finalize consent language and enforce per-event visibility toggles in API and UI.
- [ ] Ship event creation and RSVP/signup flow with tests.
- [ ] Build attendee directory with search/filter (name, interests, intent) and access controls.
- [ ] Add in-product feedback capture (survey/form) reachable from the demo path.
- [ ] Seed default demo event data and publish a repeatable demo script.
- [ ] Add opt-in analytics for page hits and drop-off on demo flows.
- [ ] Rehearse the demo; capture findings and action items in docs/ and TODO.md.

## Next (Post-MVP beta hardening)

- [ ] Expand profile fields (bio, role, company, richer interests taxonomy).
- [ ] Add consent-based interaction flows (request/share contact intent).
- [ ] Build notification preference settings without auto-notifications.
- [ ] Create admin/support runbook for refreshing demo fixtures and triaging issues.

## Later (Future exploration)

- [ ] Evaluate mobile or BLE proximity concepts after beta validation.
- [ ] Plan native mobile footprint once privacy/value are proven on web.

## Continuous

- [ ] Keep ROADMAP.md aligned with sprint outcomes.
- [ ] Capture open questions and decisions in docs/ or project notes.
- [ ] Add tests for any new API endpoints or UI flows.
- [ ] Refresh seed/demo data before each external demo.

## Completed (Foundations)

- [x] Confirm Phase 1 success metrics (usage targets, feedback volume). Approved in `docs/phase1-success-metrics.md`.
- [x] Finalize data model for events, attendee profiles, and consent fields.
- [x] Draft API contracts for event signup and attendee directory in `docs/api-contracts.md`.
- [x] Create initial UI wireframes for event signup and browsing in `docs/event-signup-directory-wireframes.md`.
- [x] Define minimal analytics/telemetry plan that honors privacy-first constraints in `docs/analytics-telemetry-plan.md`.
- [x] Identify seed data needed for demos and tests in `docs/seed-data.md`.
