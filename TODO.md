- [ ] Draft API contracts for event signup and attendee directory.
- [ ] Create initial UI wireframes for event signup and browsing.

- [ ] Add basic instrumentation for usage tracking.

## Later (Phase 2+)

- [ ] Expand profile fields (bio, role, company, interests taxonomy).

- [ ] Build notification preference settings without auto-notifications.
- [ ] Plan mobile app or BLE exploration only after Phase 2 validation.

## Continuous

- [ ] Keep ROADMAP.md aligned with sprint outcomes.
