2. Triage and assess the vulnerability.
3. Work on a fix and coordinate release of a patch.

## Disclosure Timeline

We follow a **90-day disclosure** policy:

* If a vulnerability is not resolved and publicly disclosed within **90 days** of the initial report, we reserve the right to publicly disclose the issue to protect the wider community.
