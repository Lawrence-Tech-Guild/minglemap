# Governance

## Current Status

MingleMap is currently in a **Community Draft** phase, incubated within the **Lawrence Tech Guild (LTG)** community. Formal governance processes have not yet been established, and decisions are presently made informally via discussion and consensus among active participants.

## Decision-Making Process

* **Current approach:** Community discussions and rough consensus via the LTG Slack channel (`#minglemap`) and in-person meetups.
* **Initial coordinator:** \[Your Name] (GitHub: \[your GitHub handle]) is coordinating initial setup and discussions.

## Future Governance

Governance structure, including project maintainers and formal decision-making processes, will be discussed during the **May 21, 2025 LTG Meetup**. Following community discussion and feedback, an appropriate governance model will be adopted, documented, and implemented.

## Getting Involved

Join the Slack workspace and the `#minglemap` channel to participate in discussions and shape the future governance and direction of the MingleMap project. Details can be found in the [COMMUNITY.md](./COMMUNITY.md) file.

We welcome your ideas, contributions, and feedback!
