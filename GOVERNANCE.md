# Governance

## Current Status

MingleMap is in **Community Draft** phase, incubated within the **Lawrence Tech Guild (LTG)** community. While formal governance is still emerging, we have adopted an **interim structure** to guide contributions and decision‑making until a full model is ratified.

## Provisional Maintainers (through 1 June 2025)

| Role                    | Name                                                                       | GitHub                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Interim Coordinator     | **Ted Kihm**                                                               | @Euphemystic-AI                |
| Provisional Maintainers | Self‑nominated contributors in `#minglemap` Slack prior to **1 June 2025** | *(to be listed in CODEOWNERS)* |

> After 1 June 2025 the maintainer roster will be confirmed and published in `CODEOWNERS`.

## Decision‑Making

* **Lazy consensus** – Any pull request or proposal is accepted if **no objections are raised within 72 hours**.
* A single **–1** vote from any maintainer pauses the merge and returns the item to discussion. Consensus—or a simple majority of maintainers—can overturn the –1 after concerns are addressed.

## Review Cadence

* **Weekly triage** – Every Monday, maintainers label new issues/PRs, tag `good first issue`, and assign owners.
* **Monthly roadmap review** – Conducted asynchronously in the `#minglemap` Slack channel during the first week of each month (with an optional video call) to assess milestones, blockers, and governance tweaks.

## Future Governance

A permanent governance model will be proposed at the **LTG meetup on 21 May 2025**, with a formal vote to be conducted asynchronously in the `#minglemap` Slack channel during the following week. Community feedback during the draft phase will continue to inform maintainer eligibility, voting mechanics, and term limits.

## Getting Involved

Join the Slack workspace and the `#minglemap` channel to discuss, contribute code or documentation, and help shape the project. Details are in [COMMUNITY.md](./COMMUNITY.md).
