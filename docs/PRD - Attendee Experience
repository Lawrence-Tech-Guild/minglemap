PRD: MingleMap native mobile app (Attendee Experience)

Objective
Enable seamless, purposeful, and delightful networking at in-person events by connecting attendees based on goals, skills, and real-time availability, while prioritizing privacy and user control.

Key Features

1. Onboarding & Profile Creation
   a. Sign in with LinkedIn (import avatar, job titles, employers, skills).
   b. Review/edit imported data, framed as “How can you help others?” and user chooses which Skills and Job/Employer Titles are visible to attendees.    
   c. User sets their visible “Job status”, eg: “I’m hiring / My company is hiring / I’m actively job-seeking / I’m not job seeking / I might consider other opportunities” (exact wording TBD) 
   d. Set 3-year career goal (public/private toggle).

2. Event Registration & Goal Setting
   a. Register for event
   b. Prompt: “What would you like to achieve at this event?” (show some AI-suggested goals they can select).
   c. AI matches attendee goals with other attendees’ skills (maybe it auto-updates if new matched people register after you do).
   d. Navigation Consistency: Ensure that the transition between onboarding, event registration, and networking features is seamless to prevent user confusion.
   e. Large Event Handling: Ensure the system can efficiently manage and suggest connections in events with a high number of attendees.

3. Personalized Connection Checklist
   a. Receive a curated list (3–5) of suggested attendees to meet.
   b. Each suggestion includes:
      i. Profile snapshot (photo, name, company, skills)
      ii. Shared interests/goals
      iii. AI-generated ice-breaker topics
   c. Checklist UI for marking connections as “met” and option to "Remind me to follow up"

4. Real-Time Attendee Status
   a. Automatic status: “Available” shown if no one is within 4 feet, “Busy” if someone is within 4 feet.
   b. Manual override: “Do not disturb” (user sets status, overrides auto).
   c. Status shown as colored dot on attendee avatars.

5. Request to Talk + Visual Signal
   a. Tap “Request to Talk” on attendee’s profile.
   b. If accepted, both phones display matching, brightly colored image so they can  hold their phones high to find each other visually (as well as on the map).
   c. Option to decline or set “Do not disturb.”

6. Post-Event Follow-Up
   a. In-app notifcation or email reminder with checklist of people met.
   b. Quick links to attendee LinkedIn profiles for follow-up.
   c. In the app, a running filterable list of all the people you met (and maybe ones you didn’t meet too?)

7. Privacy & Accessibility
   a. Clear privacy controls for all data.
   b. Manual status override at any time.
   c. No audio recording (though possibly voice detection to know when someone is Busy talking?)

Visually, create a modern-looking native mobile app UI that follows Apple iOS usability guidelines. It should convey a feeling of the energy potential of meeting new people and making new connections, while still looking trustworthy and professional so users feel their data and privacy is safe.
