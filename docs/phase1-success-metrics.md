# Phase 1 Success Metrics (Draft)

This document defines draft success metrics for the Phase 1 pilot (event-specific connection book).
It is intended to support a go/no-go decision for Phase 2.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Confirm these targets with event organizers before the pilot and adjust for event size.

> [!NOTE]
> These targets assume a single pilot event with 30-100 attendees and a 7-day post-event feedback window.

## Scope

Phase 1 features covered:
- Event signup with interest areas.
- Attendee profiles visible only to opt-in attendees of the same event.
- Directory browsing without automated notifications.

## Measurement window

- Pre-event window: from signup open until event start.
- Event window: during the event.
- Post-event window: up to 7 days after the event.

## Draft targets

| Metric | Target | How to measure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Signup rate | >= 25% of estimated attendees | Signups divided by estimated attendance |
| Consent opt-in rate | >= 70% of signups | Opt-in profiles divided by signups |
| Profile completion rate | >= 80% of signups | Required fields present |
| Directory usage | >= 50% of signups view directory | Unique directory viewers divided by signups |
| Feedback response rate | >= 20% of signups or >= 10 responses | Survey responses |
| "Would use again" | >= 70% positive | Survey question |

## Open decisions

- Final event size estimate to calibrate absolute targets.
- Which survey tool and delivery method will be used.
- Whether to track profile views at all (privacy vs. insight tradeoff).
