# MingleMap Application Ideation

## Privacy Enhancement

### Problem

Networking at tech events, chamber mixers, and university gatherings often relies on traditional methods, leading to missed connections and awkward interactions. Common privacy concerns include unintended exposure of personal contact details, unsolicited follow-ups, or being identified without clear consent. Participants must feel secure knowing their information is protected and shared only by choice. Additionally, users require assurance that the app will not create intrusive interruptions, such as unwanted notifications or alerts, particularly during engaging conversations at events.

### Solution

MingleMap is designed with robust privacy controls, emphasizing an unobtrusive experience that respects user consent and ensures minimal distraction. The app utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for proximity-based connections, requiring explicit opt-in from each user. Participants can easily activate or deactivate their visibility at any time, ensuring they are identified only upon explicitly opting into connections. Importantly, the app strictly adheres to user-defined notification preferences to avoid unwanted interruptions.
