# MingleMap - Smarter Networking Without Name Tags

## Overview
Connecting effectively at tech meetups, chamber mixers, and KU Innovation Park events often relies on traditional name tags, leading to awkward interactions or missed opportunities. MingleMap aims to revolutionize networking by identifying and connecting individuals automatically, securely, and consensually.

This initial ideation document outlines the foundational concepts and approach for the MingleMap application.

## Vision
Develop a mobile application leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology and seamless QR code onboarding, enabling attendees to effortlessly identify and connect with people nearby in real-time.

## How It Works

- Attendees activate the app by scanning a QR code at event entry.
- Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the app detects other users nearby who have explicitly opted in.
- Users are presented with a dynamic, live list of nearby attendees, displaying bios, company affiliations, and shared interests.
- Complete user control allows for visibility settings to be adjusted or disabled at any time.

## Privacy and User Control
MingleMap prioritizes user privacy, ensuring:

- Explicit consent for participation and identification.
- Notifications and interruptions disabled by default, with clear, intuitive opt-in settings.
- Full transparency and control over the visibility of personal details.

## Importance and Benefits

- BLE provides reliable, energy-efficient, and widely-supported proximity detection.
- Enhances networking efficiency and user experience through frictionless technology.
- Positions Lawrence as an innovative tech community leader.
- Creates an impactful, open-source project driven by local expertise and collaboration.

## Community Collaboration
Led by the Lawrence Tech Guild, MingleMap invites active participation from:

- Mobile, web, and backend developers
- UX/UI designers
- Entrepreneurs and event organizers
- Students and recent graduates seeking practical experience

## Proposed Next Steps

- Organize an initial discovery meeting or project kickoff at a Lawrence Tech Guild event.
- Establish a GitHub repository and Trello board for collaborative transparency.
- Pilot MingleMap at an upcoming community event such as LTG, Chamber, or 1 Million Cups (1MC).
- Document insights and publish findings for community-wide accessibility and enhancement.
