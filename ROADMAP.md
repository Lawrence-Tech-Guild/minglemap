# ROADMAP.md

## MingleMap Roadmap

This roadmap outlines incremental phases of development to validate the idea, gather community input, and scale complexity based on real-world feedback.

## Phase 1: Event-specific Connection Book ("Face" Book)

A simplified initial test to gauge interest and usage:

* **Event Signup:** Participants affirm attendance for specific events, stating their interest areas.
* **Attendee Profiles:** Simple, public profiles listing attendees' interests and intentions for connections.
* **Privacy First:** Explicit consent required. Profiles are only shared with attendees of the same event who opt in.
* **Minimal Notifications:** No automated notifications; purely informational for attendees to browse at their discretion.

**Goals:** Validate basic concept, measure usage and value, and solicit feedback.

## Phase 2: Interactive and Privacy-Enhanced Features

Building on user feedback from Phase 1:

* **Enhanced Profiles:** Professional bios, company affiliations, expanded interests.
* **Consent-Based Interaction:** Users explicitly opt-in to share details and interact.
* **Privacy Controls:** Robust visibility and notification controls to prevent intrusive alerts.
* **Pre-event and Real-time Browsing:** Browse participants ahead of events or during attendance.

**Goals:** Refine user experience, solidify privacy standards, and grow user base.

## Phase 3: BLE-Enabled Proximity (Future Development)

Once foundational aspects are proven and privacy concerns well-addressed:

* **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):** Seamless proximity detection for real-time interactions.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Proximity visualizations, live "nearby" views.
* **Mobile App:** Dedicated apps for Android and iOS, offering enhanced user experiences.

**Goals:** Introduce advanced technology thoughtfully, optimizing networking efficiency and user comfort.

## Immediate Next Steps

* Open a GitHub Discussion "Roadmap RFC" for community review and discussion.
* Schedule initial feedback session via Slack.
* Pilot Phase 1 at an upcoming event to test and validate the concept.

Feedback and participation from community members are vital. Please contribute your insights and ideas!
