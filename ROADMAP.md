# ROADMAP.md

## MingleMap Roadmap

This roadmap prioritizes a demo-ready MVP that proves the core event networking value while keeping privacy and consent safeguards ahead of feature expansion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MVP launches only with per-event opt-in visibility, auditable consent language, and no background notifications.

## MVP: Demo-ready Event Connection Book

- Event setup and signup: create events, capture RSVPs, and collect minimal attendee interests/intent.
- Attendee profiles with explicit visibility toggles scoped to each event.
- Browsing and discovery: searchable/filterable attendee directory for an event (name, interests, intent).
- Demo data path: seeded sample event, attendees, and fixtures for repeatable walkthroughs.
- Feedback loop: in-product survey or form plus a structured demo script for guided sessions.
- Observability: basic analytics for page hits and funnel drop-off (privacy-preserving, opt-in).

**MVP success criteria:** a full demo path from event creation through attendee browsing and feedback capture that we can run live, with opt-in privacy upheld end-to-end.

## Post-MVP (Beta Hardening)

- Profile depth: bio, role, company, richer interests taxonomy.
- Interaction requests: consent-based contact sharing and lightweight connection intents.
- Privacy controls: visibility presets, auditability of consent, and clearer copy tested with users.
- Operational readiness: admin tools for event setup, seed data refresh, and basic support runbook.

## Future (After Beta Validation)

- Notification preferences with explicit opt-in and quiet defaults.
- Mobile-friendly proximity ideas (BLE) and real-time "nearby" visualizations.
- Native mobile apps once privacy, consent, and value are validated on web.

## Validation checkpoints

- Demo rehearsal before each stakeholder or user session with fresh fixtures.
- Feedback synthesis after every demo; roadmap and TODO.md updated with decisions.
- Privacy review for any new data surfaced, stored, or logged.

## Immediate Next Steps

- Finalize consent copy and visibility rules for MVP flows.
- Build and publish the demo script plus seed data for the default event.
- Open a "Roadmap RFC" thread to collect feedback on the MVP scope and next steps.
